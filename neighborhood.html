        <p>I live in a pretty great neighborhood. We have over 60 parks and greenspaces, there are bike and walking trails, a pools and a lake. One of the things this community build out was going for was smaller yards, but more parks and green spaces for people to get outside and do things. It is charming and unique, and offers a fun way to look at a planned community.</p>
