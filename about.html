			<p>Hey! My name is Lonna. I don't often get a chance to talk about me. I am all consumed by my four children, Gwen (15), Harrison (14), Stella (11), Penelope (8), and my amazing husband James. I am kind of an odd one becasuse I like to move alot, and I don't mean at the gym. I like to change houses and move to new places. We have moved 12 times in the last 20 years. We have lived in Texas and in Utah. I love to travel and try new things.
				  <br>
			I love music and desiging things, I love to take on home projects and as much as I don't like the clean up, I love to paint. I have basically redone all the rooms in our house and I love it. 
				   <br>
			I have worked in my kids schools and for the poliece department for the last few years. As my kids have gotten older and don't need me as much I wanted something for myself that can be my own. Enter Devmountain. I am so excited to try this new life and see where I can go. The juggle of my family life and full time school has been difficult because I can't turn off mom mode and my homework is the last to get done when I head home, but I am loving the challenge even if that means I am running on >5 hours of sleep a night. I can't wait to start a new chapter. Life is full of change and new things and I am here for
